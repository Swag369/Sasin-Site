						I honestly would call myself a jack of all trades. As an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, itâ€™s hard to find free time to seriously pursue a hobby, however, throughout my time in high school, I made it a habit of pursuing such hobbies to take my mind off the stresses of school, recruiting and other stress inducers.

						At the age of 4 years old, I began learning the traditional and spiritual sounds of Indian Classical Music. I began my training in harmonium, an accordion like instrument, and shortly after began to train in singing. I continued to sing throughout all my years, and now am on Illini Awaaz, a premier co-ed South Asian Fusion A-Capella team. However, as I grew up, I made it a mission to learn as many instruments that I could. Now as a 20 year old, I have experience playing guitar, piano, violin, drums, harmonium and singing.

						As COVID-19 slowly became a threat to the health of the world, it was imperative that those who can stay at home as much as possible do so. So, as a loving government citizen, I rarely was outside and made sure that any contact I made was socially distanced. I took this time to make myself a better person. I began my journey into beat making. I purchased Logic Pro X, and with many Youtube tutorials and the help of friends, was able to take my musical creativity and make a finished product from it. Now, I am helping my A-Capella team mix songs as well as produce my own beats in my free time. On top of that, I also started learning Swift UI on Xcode. Although I am not experienced in it yet, I am working on an application.

						Back in high school, I began my journey into design, through a business competition called DECA. It was a great way for me to realize that I had a passion in UI/UX design, as I was creating application prototypes, simple yet powerful presentations and creative and knowledgeable business plans.
